__Problem 1:__

For this problem you will write a program that writes a program! More specifically
write a program that creates a file `hello.cpp`, which contains a simple "Hello World"
program. _Note: There is no reason to get clever here, take the most direct path._

---

__Problem 2:__

For this problem you will write a program that remove C++ comments from a text
file. More specifically, given an input file (`input.txt`) your program will
produce an output file (`output.txt`) which is an exact copy of the input, but
does the output does not contain lines for which the first two non-whitespace
characters are `//`. Your are not required to remove comments when `//` characters
are after non-whitespace characters, and you are not required to handle C-style
comments: `/* C-Style comment */`.

---

__Problem 3:__

For this program you will write a program that reverses a file. More specifically,
given an input file (`input.txt`) your program will reverse every line in the
input. This program does not have an output file, as it modifies the input file
directly. You may assume that your input file has 1000 lines or less, if this
helps. _Note: If you get stuck on how to solve this problem, please ask for help._
