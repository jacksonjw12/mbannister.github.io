# Homework 1

## Due: Wednesday 9/28 at 10:30am

For this assignment there will be no electronic submissions. You will answer the
questions that follow on one or more sheets of paper and submit your answers at
the start of class on the due date. Now would be a good time to review the
homework polices for the course
([link](//www.michaeljbannister.com/teaching/10-f16/#homework)). For problems 1
and 2 please show your work, but feel free to use a calculator to help with the
arithmetic.

__Problem 1:__ Convert the binary number $$11001$$ to decimal.

__Problem 2:__ Convert the decimal number $$711$$ to binary.

__Problem 3:__ What is your primary operating system (Linux/MacOS/Windows)? How
familiar you are with each of these operating systems? It is perfectly
reasonable to say "I have never used X operating system".

__Problem 4:__ In this course (and most college course) you will be spending
large amounts of time and effort working on files on your computer. It is
important that you have your files backed up somewhere other than your personal
computer. If you do not currently back up your files, now is a good time to
start. If you would like to discuss back up options, please come to office hours
or post a question on Piazza. Briefly describe how you will be backing up your
files for this course?

__Problem 5:__ What is something you would like to learn about computer science
other than how to program?
