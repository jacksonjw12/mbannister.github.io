# Final Review Questions

I have collected here an assortment of problems that you should be able to solve
using the knowledge you have gained in CSCI10. The problems are intentionally
open ended and do not reflect the style of questions that will be on the final
exam. If you can not solve the problem completely, try to simplify the problem
and solve this simplified version.

### File I/O

Chapter 6 Programming Projects (starting at page 370): 4, 5, 9

### Structs

Chapter 10 Programming Project (starting at page 612): 1

### Arrays

__Problem 1:__ Write a function `void sort(int nums[], int sz)` that sorts the
array `nums`. _Hint: We have discussed how to find the maximum element in an array!_ If you get totally stuck, the name of the sorting algorithm you should
look up is: _selection sort_.
