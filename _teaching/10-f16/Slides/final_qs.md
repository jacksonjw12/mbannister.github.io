# Final Review Questions

I have collected here an assortment of problems that you should be able to solve
using the knowledge you have gained in CSCI10. The problems are intentionally
open ended and do not reflect the style of questions that will be on the final
exam. If you can not solve the problem completely, try to simplify the problem
and solve this simplified version.
