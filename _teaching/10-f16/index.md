The department learning objectives for this course can be found here: [http://math.scu.edu/deptgoals.html#cs10](http://math.scu.edu/deptgoals.html#cs10).

## Science, Technology and Society

Science and technology increasingly exert profound effects on the natural and social worlds, including our economy, politics, health, environment, and our understanding of ourselves as human beings. This calls for further study of the science and technology that underpin debates over a wide range of topics relevant to contemporary life. To make informed decisions, students will need to grasp scientific and technological developments, how they emerge, and their social impact.

## Pathways

Keep electronic copies of all your work from this course for your _Digital Age/Design Thinking/Values in Science & Technology_ senior portfolio.

## Textbook(s) and other resources

_Problem Solving with C++, 9th_ by Walter Savitch; Pearson, 2014.  
__Purchase the edition with access code for MyProgrammingLab.__  

_Additional readings will be made available through Piazza._

## Piazza

We will use Piazza for discussions outside of the classroom. Piazza is a questions-and-answer service designed for the classroom environment. You may post questions publicly using your real name or anonymously (to your classmates).

Whenever you have a question about material being covered in class please post the question to Piazza. In this way the entire class will benefit from both your question and the answer. You should not post question to Piazza if they contain solutions, partial solutions or confidential information. For such questions please email the instructor directly.

In addition to asking questions I would encourage you to answer questions from other students. Instructors have the ability to both edit and endorse student answers, so don't worry about giving a potentially wrong answer. The best way to learn is to teach!

## Software

In this course you will spend much of your time programming using the C++ programming language. To do this you will need both a compiler and development environment. Fortunately, there are many freely available options for C++ for every common (and many not so common) operating systems.

For this course we recommend:

### Mac OS X

If you will be using a Mac running OS X, you should install Xcode which includes both a compiler and IDE. You can find Xcode in App Store and you can install it for free. It is a very large download, so you will want to be on a fast internet connection while downloading.

### GNU/Linux or MS Windows

If you will be using Linux or Windows, you should install [Code::Blocks](http://www.codeblocks.org/) which also includes both a compiler and IDE. You can download Code::Blocks from their website. __You should not use MS Visual Studio for this course, as it uses a non-standard version of C++.__

You may at your discretion use a different development environment, but you must first talk to you instructor to make sure it is compatible with the course. During the first lab, help will be available to assist you with installing the recommended environments on you laptop.

## Grading

Your grade in the course is a weighted average of your grades on homework, quizzes and exams, computed as follows:

- Presentation and Report on Societal Impact of Computing: 10%
- Homework, Lab and Participation: 20%
- Midterm Exam 1: 20%
- Midterm Exam 2: 20%
- Final Exam: 30%

The conversion from numeric score to letter grades will be determined at the end of the course, following department standards. Requests for regrades must be submitted within seven days of receiving the returned assignment.

## Homework

Homework will be assigned weekly and will consists of programing problems and short response questions pertaining to material covered in lecture and assigned reading. Typically homework will be assigned on Wednesday and due the following Wednesday. Submission instructions for homework assignments will be included with the assignment.

You have two one-day extensions to be used on homework and only homework assignments over the course of the quarter. In order to use an extension you must email me __before__ the deadline for the assignment. Each extension gives you an additional 24 hours to submit your homework electronically. When the submission of a hardcopy is required for an assignment it maybe slid under my door or returned in office hours. __No additional extensions will be given for any reason, so it would prudent to save your late days for a true emergency.__

All assignments consisting of two or more physical sheets of paper must be secured together with a __staple__; unstapled homework will receive a deduction. Weekly homework will typically be due in class on Wednesday.

You are encouraged to work with other students on the homework in this class, but the work you turn in must be your own. Keep your discussion of the problems at a high level and avoid looking at each others actual code, and __never__ type into another student's solution or tell them what to type. Copying and pasting code from any source, besides example from class, is __never__ acceptable.

## Lab

In the lab for this course you will work on small programming assignments, which are meant to help you in developing the skill needed for the homework. During lab you will be able to seek help from Instructor(s) and Lab Assistant(s). Make the good use of this resource!

As part of the lab portion of this course you will be assigned online programming problems through MyProgrammingLab. These assignments are to be complete __before__ coming to lab.

The webpage for the lab section can be found here: [math.scu.edu/~linnell/labf16/index.html](//math.scu.edu/~linnell/labf16/index.html).

__You will be using your personal computers during lab.__

## Exams

There will be two in-class midterm exams in addition to a comprehensive final exam. The date for these exams are recorded in the course schedule and are extremely unlikely to change. By registering in this class you are making a commitment to be present on for the Midterm and Final Exams on: 10/10, 10/31 and 12/9. __No makeup or early exams will be given.__

All exams will be closed-note, closed-book, closed-computer, closed-calculator and individual effort.

## Collaboration and Academic Honesty Policy

The  Academic Integrity pledge is an expression of the University’s commitment to fostering an understanding of---and commitment to---a culture of integrity at Santa Clara University. The Academic Integrity pledge, which applies to all students, states:

> I am committed to being a person of integrity. I pledge, as a member of the Santa Clara University community, to abide by and uphold the standards of academic integrity contained in the Student Conduct Code

Students are expected to uphold the principles of this pledge for all work in this class.

Unless the instructions for an assignment explicitly allow a form of collaboration, assume that the assignment is to complete by you and you alone. If for any reason you do not understand allowable forms of collaboration for a particular course or assignment, __discuss your concerns with the teaching staff for the course__.

Submitted code may be analyzed by automated plagiarism detection software, which detects structural similarities in your code with other students submitted code (this quarter and in the past) and code available on Internet repositories.

If you do not abide by the academic honesty policies, expect severe penalties. You will receive a failing grade for the course, and the offense will be reported to University. The University may take further disciplinary actions.

## Academic Accommodations

If you have a disability for which accommodations may be required in this class, please contact Disabilities Resources, Benson 216, [http://www.scu.edu/disabilities](http://www.scu.edu/disabilities) as soon as possible to discuss your needs and register for accommodations with the University. If you have already arranged accommodations through Disabilities Resources, please discuss them with me during my office hours or private appointment. Students who have medical needs related to pregnancy may also be eligible for accommodations.

While I am happy to assist you, I am unable to provide accommodations until I have received verification from Disabilities Resources. The Disabilities Resources office will work with students and faculty to arrange proctored exams for students whose accommodations include double time for exams and/or assisted technology.  (Students with approved accommodations of time-and-a-half should talk with me as soon as possible).  Disabilities Resources must be contacted in advance to schedule proctored examinations or to arrange other accommodations. The Disabilities Resources office would be grateful for advance notice of at least two weeks. For more information you may contact Disabilities Resources at 408-554-4109.
