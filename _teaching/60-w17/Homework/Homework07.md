__Submission instructions:__ You will be submitting your solutions through Camino. Please only submit the files requested on the submission page.

Complete __Part B__ of Lab 07, which has you implement the Merge Sort sorting
algorithm. Your program must test your `mergesort` function using an array of
random values. Once you are satisfied that your function is working properly
you will be timing the function using `std::chrono::high_resolution_clock`.
Write code in main to determine how long it take your function to sort and
array of size 100, 1000 and 10000. Make sure you print time in milliseconds.

You can find and example of how to do timing (for a different problem)
[here](http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/chrono/high_resolution_clock/now).
