# Homework 1

## Due: Wednesday 1/18

---

__Submission instructions:__ You will be submitting your solutions through Camino.  
Please only submit the files requested on the submission page.

---

### Problem

Write a complete C++ program that:

1. asks the user of the program for a number `num`
2. reads through a file `input.txt` counting the number of times each word occurs
3. prints out to the screen those words that occur more than `num` times, together with their actual count

For simplicity, allow words to contain punctuations, i.e., words are just strings of characters with no spaces.
Additionally, you may assume that are at most <del>500,000</del> <ins>50,000</ins> distinct words in the input file.

_This homework problem attempts to use everything you learned in CSCI 10 in one problem and will be difficult to complete if left to the last minute._

### Sample output

For the same output I am using as input the book Alice's Adventures in Wonderland by Lewis Carroll ([link](http://www.gutenberg.org/files/11/11-0.txt)).
