# Homework 1

## Due: Wednesday 1/18

---

__Submission instructions:__ You will be submitting your solutions through Camino.  
Please only submit the files requested on the submission page.

### Problem

Write a complete C++ program that:

1. asks the user of the program for a number `num`
2. reads through a file `input.txt` counting the number of times each word occurs
3. prints out to the screen those words that occur more than `num` times, together with their actual count

For simplicity, allow words to contain punctuations, i.e., words are just strings of characters with no spaces.
Additionally, you may assume that are at most 500,000 distinct words in the input file.

_This homework problem attempts to use everything you learned in CSCI 10 in one problem and will be difficult to complete if left to the last minute._
