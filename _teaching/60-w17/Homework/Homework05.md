In [Example 19](//github.com/mbannister/SCU-CSCI-60-Examples/tree/master/Example19_BagStaticArray)
we implemented a `Bag` class using fixed size arrays. Recall that a `Bag` is
essentially a multiset, i.e., it can store multiple copies of the same item.
For this homework assignment you will need to convert the `Bag` class in this
example into a `UniqueBag`. A `UniqueBag` is essentially a set, i.e., it store
only a single copy of each object. Keep the function names the same as for the
bag. You will only need to modify the function definitions and type signature
of the functions. Additionally, you will write a `main` function to test your
`UniqueBag` class. The existing `main` function can serve as a starting point.
