Object-oriented programming techniques using C++: abstract data types and objects; encapsulation; inheritance; polymorphism; the Standard Template Library; the five phases of software development (specification, design, implementation, analysis, and testing). Includes weekly lab.

Prerequisite: A grade of C- or better in CSCI 10 or equivalent.  
Corequisite: CSCI 60L  

The department learning objectives for this course can be found here: [http://math.scu.edu/deptgoals.html#cs60](link).

## Pathways

Keep electronic copies of all your work from this course for your _Digital Age/Design Thinking/Values in Science & Technology_ senior portfolio.

## Textbook(s) and other resources

_Data Structures and Other Objects Using C++, 4th_ by Michael Main and Walter Savitch; Pearson, 2014.

Example code shown in class can be found on [GitHub](//github.com/mbannister/SCU-CSCI-60-Examples).

For the most part code show in class will follow the [Google C++ Style Guide](//google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html).

_Additional readings will be made available through this web page._

## Software

In this course you will spend much of your time programming using the C++ programming language. To do this you will need both a compiler and a development environment. Fortunately, there are many freely available options for C++ for every common (and many not so common) operating systems.

For this course, we recommend you use [Qt Creator](//www.qt.io/ide/) for MacOS, Linux and Windows.

You may at your discretion use a different development environment, but you must first talk to your instructor to make sure it is compatible with the course. During the first lab, help will be available to assist you with installing the recommended environments on you laptop.

## Grading

Your grade in the course is a weighted average of your grades on homework, quizzes and exams, computed as follows:

- Homework, Lab and Participation: 20%
- Midterm Exam 1: 25%
- Midterm Exam 2: 25%
- Final Exam: 30%

The conversion from numeric score to letter grades will be determined at the end of the course, following department standards. Requests for regrades must be submitted within seven days of receiving the returned assignment.

## Homework

Homework will be assigned weekly and will consists of programing problems and short response questions pertaining to material covered in lecture and assigned reading. Typically homework will be assigned on Friday and due the following Friday. Submission instructions for homework assignments will be included with the assignment.

You have two one-day extensions to be used on homework and only homework assignments over the course of the quarter. In order to use an extension you must email me __before__ the deadline for the assignment. Each extension gives you an additional 24 hours to submit your homework electronically. __No additional extensions will be given for any reason, so it would prudent to save your late days for a true emergency.__

You are encouraged to work with other students on the homework in this class, but the work you turn in must be your own. Keep your discussion of the problems at a high level and avoid looking at each others actual code, and __never__ type into another student's solution or tell them what to type. Copying and pasting code from any source, besides example from class, is __never__ acceptable.

## Lab

In the lab for this course you will work on small programming assignments, which are meant to help you in developing the skill needed for the homework. During lab you will be able to seek help from Instructor(s) and Lab Assistant(s). Make good use of this resource!

The webpage for the lab section can be found here: [link](//math.scu.edu/~linnell/).

__You will be using your personal computers during lab.__

## Exams

There will be two in-class midterm exams in addition to a comprehensive final exam. The date for these exams are recorded in the course schedule and are extremely unlikely to change. By registering in this class you are making a commitment to be present on for the Midterm and Final Exams on: 01/30, 02/22 and 3/24. __No makeup or early exams will be given.__

All exams will be closed-note, closed-book, closed-computer, closed-calculator and individual effort.

## Collaboration and Academic Honesty Policy

The Academic Integrity pledge is an expression of the University's commitment to fostering an understanding of---and commitment to---a culture of integrity at Santa Clara University. The Academic Integrity pledge, which applies to all students, states:

> I am committed to being a person of integrity. I pledge, as a member of the Santa Clara University community, to abide by and uphold the standards of academic integrity contained in the Student Conduct Code

Students are expected to uphold the principles of this pledge for all work in this class.

Unless the instructions for an assignment explicitly allow a form of collaboration, assume that the assignment is to complete by you and you alone. If for any reason you do not understand allowable forms of collaboration for a particular course or assignment, __discuss your concerns with the teaching staff for the course__.

Submitted code may be analyzed by automated plagiarism detection software, which detects structural similarities in your code with other students submitted code (this quarter and in the past) and code available on Internet repositories.

If you do not abide by the academic honesty policies, expect severe penalties. You will receive a failing grade for the course, and the offense will be reported to University. The University may take further disciplinary actions.

## Academic Accommodations

If you have a disability for which accommodations may be required in this class, please contact Disabilities Resources, Benson 216, [http://www.scu.edu/disabilities](http://www.scu.edu/disabilities) as soon as possible to discuss your needs and register for accommodations with the University. If you have already arranged accommodations through Disabilities Resources, please discuss them with me during my office hours or private appointment. Students who have medical needs related to pregnancy may also be eligible for accommodations.

While I am happy to assist you, I am unable to provide accommodations until I have received verification from Disabilities Resources. The Disabilities Resources office will work with students and faculty to arrange proctored exams for students whose accommodations include double time for exams and/or assisted technology.  (Students with approved accommodations of time-and-a-half should talk with me as soon as possible).  Disabilities Resources must be contacted in advance to schedule proctored examinations or to arrange other accommodations. The Disabilities Resources office would be grateful for advance notice of at least two weeks. For more information you may contact Disabilities Resources at 408-554-4109.

## Discrimination and Sexual Misconduct (Title IX)

Santa Clara University upholds a zero-tolerance policy for discrimination, harassment and sexual misconduct. If you (or someone you know) have experienced discrimination or harassment, including sexual assault, domestic/dating violence, or stalking, I encourage you to tell someone promptly. For more information, please consult the Universityâ€™s Gender-Based Discrimination and Sexual Misconduct Policy at [http://bit.ly/2ce1hBb](http://bit.ly/2ce1hBb) or contact the University's EEO and Title IX Coordinator, Belinda Guthrie, at 408-554-3043, bguthrie@scu.edu.
