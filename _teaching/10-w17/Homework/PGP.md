# Encrypted Email Extra Credit

## Due: Before the start of the Final Exam

---

Send my an email encrypted with my PGP public key. You can find my  PGP public key on my webpage next to my email address. There are many ways in which you can do this, and a web search for the phrase "How to send a PGP encrypted email" should turn many up. In the past many students have used: Mailvelope (a browser plugin), GPG Suite (an OS X program), and Enigmail. However, there may be easier and more modern options out there!

Your reward is the value of one homework problem (5 points).
