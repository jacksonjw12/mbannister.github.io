# STS Presentation

The group project for this course will be to give an approximately ten-minute
presentation on a specific computing technology and its effect on society.

Your project will be broken down into four parts:

1. Group and topic selection (due Monday 3/6 by 11:59pm, earlier would be better)
2. 1-Page report (due 3/13)
3. Project presentations (last week of instruction)
4. Presentation evaluations (last week of instruction)

## Group and topic selection (2%)

Your first task is to form a group with 2 or 3 students, and to pick a topic for
you presentation. If you have difficulty picking a topic, please email me and
we can setup a time to discuss potential topics. Wikipedia is a great resource
for preliminary research on your topic.

You will submit your group and topic selection via email, please copy all group
members on the email.

## 1-Page report (38%)

Your 1-page report will serve as an outline of your presentation. Your report
must include the following information:

- A description of the computing technology.
- A brief history of the problem solved by the technology, and how the problem was solved before the technology.
- A technical discussion of how the technology solved the problem.
- An analysis of impact the technology has had on society (good/bad/complicated) and the impact society has had on the technology.
- Names of the group members
- Citations for your sources
- A brief explanation of each group members responsibility for the project.

You will submit an electronic copy emailed to me in PDF format.

## Presentation (50%)

You will have 10 minutes for your presentation. You should spend 5 to 7 minutes
on your presentation and the remainder of the time will be set aside for questions.
You should prepare slides for your presentation. For preparing your slides I would
recommend power point on windows, keynote on MacOS and LibreOffice for Linux.
Another option is to use Google's slides.

Your presentation will be evaluated based on:

- clarity, breadth, depth
- proper citation
- historical discussion of problem
- technical discussion of solution
- impact of technology on society and vice versa.

Please email a copy (or link) of your slides after your presentation.

## Evaluations (10%)

Finally, you will be giving peer-evaluations to other students presentations.
