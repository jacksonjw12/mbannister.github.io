# Homework 1

## Due: Friday 1/20

For this assignment you will be submitting your solution as a PDF file using
Camino. In your solutions to problems 1 and 2 please show your work, but feel
free to use a calculator to help with the arithmetic. If you handwrite your
solutions you may submit images or scans of your solutions, as long as the
images are of high quality and submitted as a single PDF file. There are freely
available "scanner" apps for both android and apple phones that will produce
high quality images.

__Problem 1:__ Convert the binary number $$10011$$ to decimal.

__Problem 2:__ Convert the decimal number $$322$$ to binary.

__Problem 3:__ What is your primary operating system (Linux/MacOS/Windows)? How
familiar you are with each of these operating systems? It is perfectly
reasonable to say "I have never used X operating system".

__Problem 4:__ In this course (and most college course) you will be spending
large amounts of time and effort working on files on your computer. It is
important that you have your files backed up somewhere other than your personal
computer. If you do not currently back up your files, now is a good time to
start. If you would like to discuss back up options, please come to office hours
. Briefly describe how you will be backing up your
files for this course?

__Problem 5:__ What is something you would like to learn about computer science
other than how to program?
