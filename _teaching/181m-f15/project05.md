## Proposal
Your project proposal must include:

1. The names of all team members
2. Two or three sentences describing the topic of the project
3. Two or three sentences describing what your group will be doing, e.g., coding, collecting data, running experiments, etc...
4. What languages, libraries and platforms will you be using for your project?
5. What background do the members of your team have that will allow your team to successfully complete this project?
