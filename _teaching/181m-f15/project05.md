# Project 5: Final Project

## Project due: Proposal (12/1); Short talk (12/8); Code/writeup due (12/17).

## Teams: For this project you may work alone or in teams of two or three people.

---

For this project you will be able to choose your own topic. You may work alone or in teams of up to three. Keep in mind, larger groups will be expected to do more work. Please ask me if you have any questions on what an appropriate sized is for a given group size.

## Proposal (5 Points)

For this project you will be submitting a project proposal, outlining the details of your project. If you are basing your project on an assignment from another course, you can get most of this information from that assignment's web page. Your project proposal must include:

1. The names of all team members
2. Two or three sentences describing the topic of the project
3. Two or three sentences describing what your group will be doing, e.g., coding, collecting data, running experiments, etc...
4. What languages, libraries and platforms will you be using for your project?
5. What background do the members of your team have that will allow your team to successfully complete this project?

You should submit your proposal to me by email, as we are still having trouble with our submission page. If you like, you can submit the proposal as the body of the email.

<p><b style="color:red;">It is very important that your team submits this item in on time (12/1 @ 11:59pm), as you will need feedback from your proposal when preparing your short talk.</b></p>

## Talk (15 points)

The second part of the project will be a short, three to five minute, talk on the topic of your project. In this talk you will cover the topic of your project with some example images and what your goals are for the project. For the actual presentation you may use your own computer or one of my computers. You will also need to submit a PDF version of your talk to me by email by 11:59pm on the day of the presentation (12/8). During the talk your group members should do roughly equal amounts of the speaking.

## Writeup and code (80 points)

The final part of your project will be a writeup/webpage in the style of the previous projects. In addition you must submit any code and data sets you used during your project. For publicly available data sets you may simply post a link. This will also be submitted by email on or before 12/17 @ 11:59pm.
