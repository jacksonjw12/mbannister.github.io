# Experiment 3: Noisy Gnomes

## Due: 10/08/15 @ 11:59pm

In this experiment we will study the random distribution of noise introduced by the cameras sensor when taking a picture. The outline of what you will be doing is:

1. Average multiple images to produce a "noise free" image of a scene.
2. Subtract the "noise free" images from a noisy image to get the noise.
3. Produce a histogram of the noise (see MATLAB function `historgram`).

You should try these steps on the images in the data folders `gnomes/1600_1`, `gnomes/1600_5` and `gnomes/1600_80`. Each of these folders contain several images of the same scene taken under similar conditions.

Your solution should contain the code you have written and a short comment at the top on what you discovered.

## Submitting your solution
You will be submitting your solutions via the following web form: [submission page](//www.dci.pomona.edu/tools-bin/cs181mupload.php). When you are happy with your solution please `tar` or `zip` your MATLAB file(s) together and submit the archive with the name `Experiment02.tar` or `Experiment02.zip`, as appropriate. Please do not include the images from the data set in your archive. Please do include your name in a comment at the top of all submitted matlab files.

## Academic honest policy
You may freely collaborate on this assignment, but all code you turn in (with
the excepting of starter code) must have been written by you, i.e., you may not
copy-and-paste another student's solution.
