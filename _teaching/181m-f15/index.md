## Textbooks and other resources

_Computer Vision: Algorithms and Applications_  
by [Richard Szeliski](//research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/szeliski/)  
Springer  
ISBN 978-1-84882-935-0  
[Free pdf download from Springer Link](//doi.org/10.1007/978-1-84882-935-0)  

Additional readings will be linked from the course schedule.

## Grading

Your grade will be based on a weighted average of your grades on the assigned experiments and projects, as follows:

- Experiments: 15% (~1% each)
- Projects 1--4: 60% (15% each)
- Project 5: 25%

The conversion to letter grades will be determined at the end of the course.

## Experiments
There will be approximately fifteen short programming experiments, each of which should take no more than an hour to complete. The purpose of these experiments is to gain intuition for the material covered in class. The experiments are considered individual assignments. The experiments will need to be completed in [MATLAB](//www.mathworks.com/products/matlab/) or [OCTAVE](//www.gnu.org/software/octave/). _Note: MATLAB is available for free through the college._

- Experiment 1: Color to black and white
- Experiment 2: Median filtering and unsharp masking

## Projects
There will be five projects, each of which will require a substantial time investment. __Start the projects early!__ The purpose of the projects is to gain a deep understanding for the challenges of implementing some of the methods presented in class. For the final project (Project 5) you will be free to choose the topic. In addition, you will be giving an in class presentation on Project 5. It is recommend that you complete the projects using [MATLAB](//www.mathworks.com/products/matlab) or [OCTAVE](//www.gnu.org/software/octave/), but you may use another language (e.g., [Julia](//julialang.org/)) with instructor permission. _Note: MATLAB is available for free through the college._

- Project 1: Images of the Russian empire
- Project 2: Compositing
- Project 3: Photo mosaics (panoramas)
- Project 4: High dynamic range photography
