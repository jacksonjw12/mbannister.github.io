# CS 62: Extra Credit Lab 13

# Wednesday May 04, 2016

---

Today's lab is optional and is considered extra credit. You will be working on
several small recursion problem available at [http://codingbat.com](http://codingbat.com)
a coding tutorial site with support for Java and Python. Please complete the
exercises in Java. In all of the exercises you will be implementing a single method,
so it is not unlike programming in C!

If you create an account on the site, you can track your progress as you work
through the exercises, but this is not necessary.

## The actual lab

Solve as many exercise in the following two links as you can:
[Recursion 1](http://codingbat.com/java/Recursion-1) and [Recursion 2](http://codingbat.com/java/Recursion-1).

Keep your solutions recursive! You should not need to use loops at all.

## What to turn in

Paste your favorite four solutions into a text file and submit it to the dropbox
with the usual naming convention. No JSON file or directory needed.
