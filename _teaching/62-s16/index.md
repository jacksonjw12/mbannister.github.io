## Catalog description

Key topics include abstract data types (including stacks, queues, trees, priority queues and dynamic dictionaries), analysis of algorithms (including worst-case, average-case and amortized analysis) and program verification. Extensive practice in Java. Includes an introduction to manual memory management in C/C++. Serves the same role as CSCI 070 HM as a prerequisite for upper-division computer science courses at any of The Claremont Colleges.

Prerequisite: CSCI 051 CM or CSCI 051 PO.

## Piazza

We will use Piazza for discussions outside of the classroom. Piazza is a questions-and-answer service designed for the classroom environment. You may post questions publicly using your real name or anonymously (to your classmates), additionally you may post questions privately to your instructors and TAs. In general, the only reason a question should be posted privately is if it concerns your grade or other private matters.

## Grading

Your grade in the course is a weighted average of your grades on homework, quizzes and exams, computed as follows:

- Quizzes + Labs: 10%
- Assignments: 35%
- Exam 1: 15%
- Exam 2: 15%
- Final Exam: 25%

The conversion from numeric score to letter grades will be determined at the end of the course.

## Collaboration and Academic Honesty Policy

As a student in this course, you are expected to understand and follow the academic honest policies of Pomona College (or your home campus) and the Department of Computer Science. Please take a few minutes to familiarize yourself with these policies: [Department of Computer Science Academic Honesty Policy](http://www.cs.pomona.edu/academichonesty); [Pomona College Academic Honesty Policy](http://catalog.pomona.edu/content.php?catoid=7&navoid=394). Unless the instructions for an assignment explicitly allow a form of collaboration, assume that the standard academic honesty policies apply. If for any reason you do not understand how the academic policies apply to a particular course or assignment, discuss your concerns with the teaching staff for the course.

Submitted code may be analyzed by automated plagiarism detection software, which detects structural similarities in your code with other students submitted code (this quarter and in the past) and code available on Internet repositories.

All exams will be closed-note, closed-book, closed-computer and individual effort.

If you do not abide by the academic honesty policies, expect severe penalties. The first offense will result in failure in the course and will be reported to the Dean of Students Office. In the event of a second offense, the offense will be reported to the Board of Academic Discipline. For further explanation of the penalties see the academic honest policies linked above.

## Academic Accommodations
If you are seeking academic accommodations, you must contact your home college's disability coordinator to establish accommodations. You should plan to meet with your coordinator to discuss appropriate accommodations and may be asked to provide documentation necessary to verify disabilities. The disability coordinators for the Claremont Colleges are:
<a href='mailto:Jan.Collins-Eaglin@pomona.edu'>Jan Collins-Eaglin (Pomona)</a>,
<a href='mailto:julia.easley@claremontmckenna.edu'>Julia Easley (CMC)</a>,
<a href='mailto:Jill_Hawthorne@pitzer.edu'>Jill Hawthorne (Pitzer)</a>,
<a href='mailto:sdelator@scrippscollege.edu'>Sonia De la Torre Iniguez (Scripps)</a> and
<a href='mailto:hbird@hmc.edu'>Heidi Bird (HMC)</a>.

## Recording
Pomona College prohibits video or voice recording of any lecture or discussion, except in cases that the office of the Dean of Students has granted a student permission according to the College’s Disability Accommodations Policy, or when permission is granted by the instructor. I choose to give permission in this course to be recorded by students. These recordings are for any reasonable use that arises from participation in this course. __These recordings cannot be distributed, transmitted or published in any media or form, nor be used for any commercial purposes.__
